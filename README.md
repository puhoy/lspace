## requirements

python >=3.4 and pip should be fine


## installation

`pip install lspace`


## setup 

after installation, you should run

`lspace init`

this will setup a new configuration file, which you can edit to specify the structure of your library, for example.

a default config file would look like this:
```
database_path: sqlite:////home/USER/.config/lspace/lspace.db
file_format: '{SHELVE}/{AUTHORS}_{TITLE}'
library_path: ~/library
loglevel: error
default_shelve: misc
default_author: no author
default_language: no language
default_publisher: no publisher
```

#### database path

path to your database. 
the project uses sqlalchemy, so all databases supported by sqlalchemy should be fine.

#### file_format

template string for storing the plain files in the library.

`{SHELVE}/{AUTHORS}_{TITLE}` would produce files like `scifi/cixin-liu_three-body-problem.epub`

author and title will be automatically slugified for this.

possible variables to use are: AUTHORS, TITLE, SHELVE, YEAR, LANGUAGE, PUBLISHER

#### library path

where the imported files are stored

#### loglevel

#### default_{shelve, author, language, publisher}

the default field names, in case nothing is specified in import


## usage

### importing

`lspace import path/to/ebook.epub`

`lspace import path/to/folder/*`

### searching your library

`lspace list QUERY [--path]`

for example, 

`lspace list programming --path`

would return something like

    /home/USER/library/donald-e-knuth/art-of-computer-programming-volume-2.pdf
    /home/USER/library/donald-e-knuth/the-art-of-computer-programming-volume-1-fascicle-1.pdf

and 

`lspace list dwarf`

would return return

    Peter Tyson - Getting Started With Dwarf Fortress

### removing stuff

`lspace remove QUERY`

this command will ask you before it actually deletes stuff :)

    Peter Tyson - Getting Started With Dwarf Fortress
    /home/USER/library/peter-tyson/getting-started-with-dwarf-fortress.epub
    delete this book from library? [y/N]:

### exporting books


`lspace export QUERY ~/some/folder/ --format mobi`

would convert all books matching on QUERY to 'mobi' and export them to ~/some/folder

to actually export to another format, you need "ebook-convert", which is part of [calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/)!

## why "L-space"?

its named after discworlds [library-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dimensions_of_the_Discworld#L-space) dimension :)
