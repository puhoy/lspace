# L-Space

a cli ebook manager built around [isbnlib](https://github.com/xlcnd/isbnlib)

currently supports epub and pdf


the whole thing is pretty much just a weekend project, so i would be happy about reported issues or pull requests!


## requirements

just python3 and pip should be fine


## installation

`pip install git+https://github.com/puhoy/lspace`


## setup 

after installation, you should run

`lspace init`

this will setup a new configuration file, which you can edit to specify the structure of your library, for example.


## usage

### importing

`lspace import path/to/ebook.epub`
`lspace import path/to/folder/*`

### searching your library

`lspace list QUERY [--path]`

for example, 

`lspace list programming --path`

would return something like

    /home/USER/library/donald-e-knuth/art-of-computer-programming-volume-2.pdf
    /home/USER/library/donald-e-knuth/the-art-of-computer-programming-volume-1-fascicle-1.pdf

and 

`lspace list dwarf`

would return return

    Peter Tyson - Getting Started With Dwarf Fortress

### removing stuff

`lspace remove QUERY`

this command will ask you before it actually deletes stuff :)

    Peter Tyson - Getting Started With Dwarf Fortress
    /home/meatpuppet/library/peter-tyson/getting-started-with-dwarf-fortress.epub
    delete this book from library? [y/N]:
